    <string name="explanation">
        The ODM version check has failed. This means your system is currently using
        a version of the proprietary binaries, which your Android is not build for. This will may work
        without further problems, but could also harm your device in the future.\n
        Please consider upgrading them as soon as possible. Commonly you could just update the oem
        partition(s) with the expected version - but for further reference please visit a guide for
        your specific device (you may press the help button below).
